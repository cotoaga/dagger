## What Makes DAGGER v0.3 Revolutionary

DAGGER solves the fundamental constraint that kills deep thinking: **linear conversation interfaces hit context bandwidth limits**. Instead of losing your train of thought in tangents, DAGGER provides:

### 🧠 Distributed Cognition Architecture
- **Branch without losing context**: Explore tangents while preserving main thread
- **Drag-to-merge synthesis**: Visual hierarchical merging of conversation branches  
- **Extended thinking mode**: Advanced reasoning with Claude Sonnet 4 + Opus 4
- **Temperature control**: Fine-tune AI creativity (0.1=Focused ↔ 1.0=Creative)
- **Real-time topology mapping**: Live conversation graph with Cytoscape.js

### 🗺️ Knowledge Navigation System
- **Conversation cartography**: Map complex thinking as you explore it
- **Cross-branch synthesis**: Merge insights from parallel explorations
- **Dimensional navigation**: Zoom in/out/across conversation topology
- **Context preservation**: Never lose threading in complex discussions

## v0.3 Technical Architecture

### Enhanced Dual-Server Design
DAGGER v0.3 requires coordinated operation of two sophisticated systems:

#### 1. Enhanced API Proxy Server (Port 3001)
```bash
npm run dev:proxy
```
- **Claude Sonnet 4/Opus 4 Integration**: Latest model support with extended thinking
- **Dynamic Timeout Scaling**: Smart API timeouts (30s-3min) based on complexity
- **Temperature Passthrough**: Real-time creativity control with metadata tracking
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery with user feedback
- **CORS Resolution**: Seamless browser-to-API communication

#### 2. Advanced React Application (Port 5173)
```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Sophisticated State Management**: Complex branching with merge conflict resolution
- **Real-time Interaction System**: Drag feedback, visual state updates, branch validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering for large conversation networks

### Conversation Mental Model
```javascript
// v0.3 Advanced Operations
graph.addConversation(prompt, response, {temperature: 0.7, model: 'claude-sonnet-4'})
graph.createBranch(parentId, branchType)
graph.dragToMerge(sourceNode, targetNode)  // NEW: Visual merge operations
graph.validateHierarchicalMerge(source, target)  // NEW: Prevents graph corruption
graph.exportWithMergeHistory()  // NEW: Complete topology export
```

## Quick Start v0.3

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Claude API key to .env
```

### 1. Start Enhanced Proxy Server
```bash
