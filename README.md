> **Distributed cognition architecture that transforms linear chat into navigable knowledge topology**

DAGGER solves the fundamental constraint of conversational AI: **context bandwidth limitations**. Instead of losing your train of thought in tangents, DAGGER provides sophisticated conversation branching with drag-to-merge synthesis, enabling true knowledge cartography.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### System Requirements
- **Node.js 18+** (crypto API support required)
- **Modern Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Claude API Key** (Anthropic account required)
- **Command Line Access** (Terminal/PowerShell)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is NOT a static HTML file
**DO NOT** try to open `index.html` directly in your browser. DAGGER is a sophisticated React application that requires development servers to function.

### Installation
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd dagger
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Claude API key to .env: CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Launch DAGGER v0.3 (BOTH SERVERS REQUIRED)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start enhanced proxy server (MUST RUN FIRST)
npm run dev:proxy
# ✅ Proxy operational on http://localhost:3001

# Terminal 2: Start advanced frontend (NEW TERMINAL)
npm run dev
# ✅ DAGGER interface active on http://localhost:5173
```

### 🎯 Access Your Knowledge Cartography Tool
**Open your browser to: http://localhost:5173**

### Why Two Servers?
- **Proxy Server (3001)**: Handles Claude API authentication, CORS, timeout scaling
- **React App (5173)**: Serves the sophisticated conversation interface with graph visualization
- **Both Required**: The frontend calls the proxy, which calls Claude API

**If you skip the proxy server, the Claude API integration will fail completely.**

### Production Deployment
```bash
npm run build     # Creates static files in /dist
npm run preview   # Local production testing
# Note: Still requires proxy server for Claude API calls
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Blank screen?** → Check both servers are running
- **API errors?** → Verify your Claude API key in .env
- **Module errors?** → Run `npm install` and restart servers
- **Port conflicts?** → Vite will auto-assign different ports if 5173 is busy

**Remember: DAGGER is distributed cognition architecture, not a simple webpage.** 🗡️

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Dual-Server Design
```
React App (5173) ← Enhanced Proxy (3001) ← Claude Sonnet 4/Opus 4 API
      ↓                    ↓                        ↓
 Graph Visualization  Dynamic Timeouts     Extended Thinking
 Drag-to-Merge       Temperature Control   Advanced Reasoning
 State Management    Error Handling        Multi-Model Support
```

### Core Technologies

## 🤝 Contributing

### Development Philosophy
DAGGER is built with **distributed cognition principles** - human intuition + AI pattern recognition + visual knowledge mapping. Contributions should enhance this cognitive amplification architecture.

### Key Principles
- **Problem-First Thinking**: What cognitive behavior are we enabling?
- **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor workflow
- **Conversation-Aware Design**: Think in terms of knowledge cartography
- **Performance Conscious**: Optimize for complex conversation networks

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/knowledge-enhancement`
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Build locally: `npm run build`
5. Submit PR with clear cognitive improvement description

### Testing Requirements
All new features must include:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for conversation flow
- Performance tests for graph operations
- User experience validation

### Crystal Clear Terms for the Cognitively Challenged:

**YES, YOU CAN COPY THIS.** In fact, I'm assuming you need help figuring out how distributed cognition actually works, so I'm giving you a helping hand:

- ✅ **Copy freely**: Clone, fork, study the code - I expect you to
- ✅ **Learn something**: This is how you build knowledge cartography tools that don't suck
- ✅ **Attribution required**: Give credit where it's due - Kurt Cotoaga built this
- ❌ **No commercial use**: Don't monetize my work without permission

### The Philosophy:
DAGGER exists because most "AI chat interfaces" miss the fundamental problem: **context bandwidth limitations kill deep thinking**. If you're building yet another linear chat wrapper, you're solving the wrong problem. This is how you actually amplify human-AI cognition.
