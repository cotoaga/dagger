# üó°Ô∏è DAGGER v0.5.0 - Knowledge Cartography Platform

**Advanced conversational AI platform with distributed cognition architecture**

> "Context bandwidth is the bottleneck. DAGGER transforms linear chat into navigable knowledge topology where thoughts branch, merge, and scale beyond single conversation limits."

## What is DAGGER?

DAGGER solves the fundamental constraint that kills deep thinking: **linear conversation interfaces hit context bandwidth limits**. Instead of losing your train of thought in tangents, DAGGER provides:

### üß† Distributed Cognition Architecture
- **Branch without losing context**: Explore tangents while preserving main thread
- **Drag-to-merge synthesis**: Visual hierarchical merging of conversation branches  
- **Extended thinking mode**: Advanced reasoning with Claude Sonnet 4
- **Temperature control**: Fine-tune AI creativity (0.1=Focused ‚Üî 1.0=Creative)
- **Real-time topology mapping**: Live conversation graph with Cytoscape.js
- **Token economics integration**: Real-time cost tracking and usage analytics

### üó∫Ô∏è Knowledge Navigation System
- **Conversation cartography**: Map complex thinking as you explore it
- **Cross-branch synthesis**: Merge insights from parallel explorations
- **Dimensional navigation**: Zoom in/out/across conversation topology
- **Context preservation**: Never lose threading in complex discussions
